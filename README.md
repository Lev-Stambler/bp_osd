# BP+OSD (C version)
A C library implementing belief propagation with ordered statistics post-processing for decoding quantum codes.

## Build
To build, run the following commands from the repository root.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
cd ..
```

## Running the BP+OSD Sim
The C++ source file for the BP+OSD sim script can be found at sim_scripts/bp_osd_decode.cpp
The example program to decode a 16_4_6 MKMN code can be run (from the repository root) with the following command

```
build/bp_osd_decode sim_scripts/mkmn_input_test.json sim_scripts/output
```

The general syntax for running the sim script is as follows

```
./build/bp_osd_decode <path_to_input_file.json> <path_to_output_directory>
``` 

### Input file structure
The bp_osd_decode script takes JSON files as input. An example input file is shown below:
```c
{
  "hx_filename": "codes/random/mkmn/hgp_mkmn_16_4_6_hx.alist",
  "lx_filename": "codes/random/mkmn/hgp_mkmn_16_4_6_lx.alist",
  "code_label": "mkmn_16_4_6",
  "input_seed": 666,
  "bit_error_rate": 0.05,
  "target_runs": 1000,
  "osd_order": 40,
  "max_iter": 50,
  "osd_method": "combination_sweep"
}
```

Where

- "hx_filename": path to hx parity check alist file
- "lx_filename": path to lx logical matrix alist file
- "code_label": whatever you like
- "input_seed": the input seed for the Mersenne twister rng
- "bit_error_rate": the bit error rate
- "target_runs": the number of runs you would like to simulate
- "osd_order": the osd order parameter
- "max_iter": the iterations depth for BP. If this is set to 0, then the value is set to N, where N is the code block length.
- "osd_method": Currenlty two options are implemented. 1) "combination_sweep"; 2) "exhaustive". Both of these are described in the paper.

### Output
The output is saved to the directory specified in the second command line argument. The output file format is JSON and the filename is autogenerated.

## Alist files

Alist files for the Surface and Toric codes can be found in the "codes" directory.
